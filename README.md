Project Question: You are hired as a network engineer for Qwerty Infotech 
Ltd., a mid-sized enterprise with a seven-floor office building. Each 
floor is equipped with 7 computers, and the organization requires a 
well-structured network to ensure efficient communication and 
scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1. Topology Selection: Design a mesh topology for three floors 
and then a ring topology for the remaining floors, considering 
performance and fault tolerance.
2. IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class 
B public IPv4 addresses following a classful addressing 
scheme. Allocate IP addresses properly for each floor, ensuring 
uniqueness.
3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication & 
Connectivity: Recommend a routing approach that is static
for inter-floor communication.
 Design how the floors will be connected for seamless interdepartment communication.
 Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches, 
routers, access points) and their placement.
 If using dynamic routing, suggest an appropriate routing 
protocol (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) with justification.
 If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data 
flow.
 Specify the number of default gateways along with IP 
addresses.
